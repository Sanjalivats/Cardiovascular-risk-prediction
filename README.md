# Cardiovascular-risk-prediction
This repository contains a project on cardiovascular risk prediction. Classification goal in this project is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). Here, we have to build a Predictive Model which will give early detections of heart disease.
Of all heart diseases, coronary heart disease (aka heart attack) is by far the most common and the most fatal. In the United States, for example, it is estimated that someone has a heart attack every 40 seconds and about 805,000 Americans have a heart attack every year (CDC 2019).

Doctors and scientists alike have turned to machine learning (ML) techniques to develop screening tools and this is because of their superiority in pattern recognition and classification as compared to other traditional statistical approaches.

So, here classification goal is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.

Each attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic, behavioral, and medical risk factors. Here, we have to build a Predictive Model which will give early detections of heart disease.
